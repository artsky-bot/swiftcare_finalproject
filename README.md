*Swift Care* is a medicine website created by the stakeholder requirements (the professor). The purpose of this website was to experience creating a project in a software engineering environment where students work as a team and figure out ways to complete each module. In our case, we worked on an agile process model which was known as XP (Extreme Programming).
